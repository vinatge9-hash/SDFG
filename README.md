# Serene Health Clinic - Website Build

This repository contains a ready-to-run, static three-page website for Serene Health Clinic.

What you get:

- index.html (Home)
- about.html (About Us)
- contact.html (Contact & Appointments)
- README.md (this file)

Key design decisions:
- Tailwind CSS used via CDN for rapid, responsive styling
- Google Font Inter for accessibility and readability
- Semantic HTML with proper headings for SEO and screen readers
- Placeholder images using the required syntax: src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1756755726512-501b3e79df8f?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHwuLi58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTc1NzE2MDg4OHww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080'
- Full, static HTML pages with a responsive, accessible layout

How to run locally:
1. Open any of the HTML files in a modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2. No server required; files are static.

Notes:
- The color palette uses: white backgrounds, calming blue for CTAs (#3B82F6), soft green accents (#10B981) can be added where needed, and dark gray text (#374151).
- All images use the placeholder syntax as requested.
- Footer includes 2025 copyright as per current date provided.

If you want me to adjust copy, add more pages (e.g., Services detail, FAQs), or customize colors, just tell me and Iâ€™ll update the build.
